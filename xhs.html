        <h2>Introduction: Mobile Phones as Human Extensions</h2>
        <p>In today’s world, it’s nearly impossible to find someone without a mobile phone — and for most, it’s a constant companion. Phones have become extensions of the human body, enabling us to text, learn, entertain, and connect from virtually anywhere. Unlike computers, mobile phones are truly “mobile,” allowing people to stay productive and engaged on the go.</p>
        <p>This accessibility has transformed industries, especially e-commerce. Consumers now browse and buy products from anywhere: at home, on public transit, even while traveling abroad. <strong>As social media platforms integrate e-commerce features, a new hybrid space has emerged: one where digital interaction and commerce converge.</strong></p>
